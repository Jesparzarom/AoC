# AoC
### This repository contains my solutions for the challenge event "Advent Of Code 2022".

#### Comments:

I know that some solutions could be more efficient, because at that time I had not learned the operation of ; `all()`, `map()`, `filter()`,  `lambda` functions or others efficient methods.

However, the important thing for me was to learn along the way and test myself on these challenges. It is the first time I participate in something like this.

Not all the challenges are solved mainly because of my limitations; we have to know what our limits are. That doesn't mean that we can't overcome them later.
